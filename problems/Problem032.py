"""
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

# =============================================================================
# We can show that the only possible situations are as follows:
#
#   (1-digit number) x (4-digit number) = (4-digit number)
#   (2-digit number) x (3-digit number) = (4-digit number)
#
# Therefore, we iterate through all the permutations of the digits 1 through 9
# partition them accordingly, and check to see of the product identity holds.
