"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
"""
# =============================================================================
# The largest number that is the product of two 3-digit numbers is 999^2 which
# is 998,001. Therefore, the largest possible answer is 997,799. Starting here,
# we generate each palindrome p, find the divisors, see if there exists a
# divisor d such that sqrt(p) < d < 1000. If this divisor exists, and p is a 
# 6-digit number then p / d will also be 3-digits, and we have our solution.
