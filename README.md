# ProjectEuler
Project Euler files and solutions.

This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenges found on ProjectEuler.net.

**problems**: each file, when executed, will print the solution as well as the calculation time.
              files also contain a brief explanation of the algorithm/methodology used.
  
**functions**: contains all helper functions used in solving various problems
           **combinatorics:** functions related to combinations and permutations
           **conversions:** functions for converting between variable types
           **integers:** functions related to the properties of integers, and their factors/divisors/multiples
           **sequences:** functions related to creating sequences of numbers
           **summation:** functions related to summing numbers

**text_files:** .txt files for certain problems
